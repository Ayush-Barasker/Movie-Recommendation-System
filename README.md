🔍 Project Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to suggest movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences. By employing machine learning algorithms, the system learns from the data and predicts movies that users are likely to enjoy.

✨ Features
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests movies based on user preferences.
Scalable Architecture: Can handle large datasets efficiently.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate UI for better user experience.
Multiple Algorithms: Supports various recommendation algorithms.
🛠 Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
Prepare your dataset:

Ensure your movie dataset is in CSV format and placed in the data folder.
Run the recommendation script:

bash
Copy code
python recommend.py
Access the application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to start using the recommendation system.
🧠 Algorithm Details
The system employs the following algorithms to generate recommendations:

Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interactions to predict preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Utilizes item features and user profiles.
Hybrid Models: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for improved accuracy.
🔮 Future Enhancements
In future updates, we aim to:

Integrate Deep Learning Models: Enhance prediction accuracy using neural networks.
Real-Time Recommendations: Implement real-time data processing for instant suggestions.
Mobile Compatibility: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the application.
